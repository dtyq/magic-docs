# Magic - AI Application Development Platform

Magic is an AI application development platform with core features including:

## 1. Real-time Chat

Magic's enterprise internal chat feature supports multiple users online simultaneously, with a clean and intuitive interface similar to WeChat, making it easy for employees to use. Whether it's one-on-one private communication or group discussions with multiple participants, conversations can be initiated instantly.

In terms of group management, it has powerful permission settings that allow administrators to flexibly assign different member permissions, such as:
- Setting certain members as administrators responsible for daily group management and maintenance
- Restricting some members' speaking permissions to ensure orderly group discussions

Through this instant messaging functionality, internal enterprise communication becomes faster and more efficient, information can be delivered promptly, and work efficiency is significantly improved.
