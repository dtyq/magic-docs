# Key Concepts

## Nodes
Nodes are the key components of a workflow. By connecting nodes with different functions, a series of operations in the workflow can be executed. For core workflow nodes, please refer to the node documentation.

## Variables
Variables are used to connect the input and output between nodes in a workflow, enabling complex processing logic within the flow. They include environment variables and session variables (planned for future support).

## Quick Commands
Quick commands are an efficient interaction method that uses preset or custom operation sequences to quickly trigger specific functions or tasks. We provide an efficient setup method that simplifies complex operations into one-click or voice commands (planned for future upgrades). They can be set in both the toolbar and dialog box, helping users break through efficiency bottlenecks while reducing dependence on technical details.
