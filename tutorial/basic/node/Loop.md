# Loop Node

## What is a Loop Node?
The Loop Node is a flow control node in Magic Flow workflow that allows you to repeatedly execute a series of operations until a specific condition is met or a specified number of iterations is completed. Simply put, the Loop Node acts like a "repeat execution" instruction, helping you automate repetitive tasks and improve work efficiency.

**Image Description:**
The Loop Node interface includes two main parts: the outer "Loop" component and the inner "Start Node". In the Loop component, you can set the loop type, loop conditions, or count; the Start Node represents the starting point of each loop iteration.

## Why Do We Need Loop Node?
In building intelligent applications, the Loop Node solves the problem of needing to repeat certain operations, it can:
- **Batch Process Data**: Perform the same operation on each element in a list or array
- **Retry Attempts**: Continue executing a task until specific conditions are met
- **Timed Execution**: Repeat tasks a fixed number of times
- **Dynamic Workflow**: Flexibly decide execution count based on actual situations
- **Save Work**: Avoid manually copying and pasting the same node sequence

## Application Scenarios
### 1. Batch Data Processing
Process a set of data, such as sending personalized messages to a customer list or processing each row in a table.

### 2. Retry Mechanism
Retry when certain operations fail, until success or maximum attempt count is reached.

### 3. Paginated Requests
When multiple API calls are needed to get paginated data, control request count and parameter changes through loops.

### 4. Periodic Checking
Repeatedly check a status according to set count or conditions, such as regularly checking task completion status.

## Node Parameter Description
### Basic Parameters
|Parameter Name|Parameter Type|Required|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|Loop Type|Dropdown|Yes|Select loop type, including "Count Loop", "Array Loop", and "Condition Loop"|
|Loop Count|Number/Variable|Depends on type|When "Count Loop" is selected, set total number of loop executions|
|Loop Array|Variable|Depends on type|When "Array Loop" is selected, specify array or list to iterate over|
|Loop Condition|Expression|Depends on type|When "Condition Loop" is selected, set condition expression for loop continuation|
|Current Index Variable Name|Text|No|Variable name to store current loop index, defaults to "loopIndex"|
|Current Element Variable Name|Text|No|Variable name to store current loop element, defaults to "loopItem"|
|Maximum Loop Count|Number|No|Safety limit to prevent infinite loops, set maximum executable loop count|

## Usage Instructions
### Basic Configuration Steps
1. **Choose Loop Type**:
    1. By Count: Suitable when exact execution count is known
    2. Array Iteration: Suitable when needing to process each array element
    3. Condition Check: Suitable when needing to stop only when specific conditions are met
2. **Configure Loop Parameters**:
    1. By Count: Set specific loop count, like "10"
    2. Array Iteration: Select or input array variable to iterate over
    3. Condition Check: Set loop condition expression and maximum loop count
3. **Configure Loop Body**:
    1. Add nodes that need to be repeatedly executed inside loop node
    2. These nodes will execute repeatedly according to loop settings
4. **Handle Loop Results**:
    1. Can use variable save node to save intermediate results within loop
    2. After loop ends, these variables are available for subsequent nodes

## Important Notes
### Performance Considerations
Loop nodes may extend workflow execution time:
- Avoid setting too large loop counts
- Consider batch processing for large amounts of data
- Always set reasonable maximum loop count for condition loops to prevent infinite loops

### Variable Scope in Loops
Variables modified in loops affect subsequent iterations:
- If independent variables needed for each loop, reinitialize at loop start
- Variable modifications in loop persist until loop ends

### Loop Nesting Limitations
While technically supporting nested loops, note:
- Nested loops significantly increase execution complexity and time
- Recommend no more than 2 levels of nesting to maintain workflow maintainability
- Pay special attention to setting reasonable loop counts when nesting loops

## Common Issues
### Issue 1: What If Loop Node Executes More Times Than Expected?
**Solutions**: Loop conditions might be improperly set. Recommend:
- Check if loop conditions are correctly set
- Ensure condition judgment variables are updated at appropriate times
- Use code node to manually set break flags to end loop early

### Issue 2: What If Nodes Inside Loop Don't Execute as Expected?
**Solutions**: This might have several causes:
- Ensure nodes inside loop body are correctly connected
- Check if condition judgments for each node are correct
- Use variable save node to save intermediate results for debugging
- Check if variables used in loop are correctly initialized

### Issue 3: How to Save Results from Each Iteration in Loop?
**Solutions**: You can:
- Use array variables to collect results from each loop
- Add results to array in code execution node
- After loop ends, array will contain results from all iterations
```javascript
// Initialize results array (before loop)
context.variableSave("results", []);

// Save each result inside loop
let results = context.variableGet("results", []);
results.push(someResult);
context.variableSave("results", results);
```

## Best Practices
### Common Paired Nodes
|Node Type|Pairing Reason|
|---|---|
|Code Execution Node|Handle complex logic in loops, operate on arrays and objects|
|Conditional Branch Node|Execute different operations in loop based on conditions|
|Variable Save Node|Store intermediate results or accumulated values in loop|
|HTTP Request Node|Send batch requests or get paginated data|
|Data Storage Node|Save loop processing results to persistent storage|
