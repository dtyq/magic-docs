Prerequisites
Node.js version 18 or higher.
Terminal for accessing VitePress via its command line interface (CLI).
Text Editor with Markdown syntax support.
VSCode is recommended, along with the official Vue extension.


VitePress can be used on its own, or be installed into an existing project. In both cases, you can install it with:

`npm add -D vitepress`

The docs:dev script will start a local dev server with instant hot updates. Run it with the following command:



`npm run docs:dev`

Instead of npm scripts, you can also invoke VitePress directly with:

`npx vitepress dev docs`
